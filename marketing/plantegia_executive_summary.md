# Plantegia — Executive Summary

## Project Overview

**Product:** Plantegia — a spatial and temporal planning tool for indoor growers with multiple grow spaces (tents/rooms).

**Problem Solved:** Managing perpetual harvest setups is complex. Growers struggle to plan when one plant transitions to flowering while another needs to be planted. Current solutions (spreadsheets, pen & paper, generic apps) don't address the spatial-temporal planning aspect.

**Unique Value Proposition:** Visual planning across space (tent layout) AND time (Gantt-style lifecycle view). See at a glance where each plant is, when it transitions between stages, and how to optimize rotation.

## Market Analysis

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

| Region | Indoor Home Growers | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| USA | ~1.7M | 56% of 3M home growers grow indoor |
| Germany | ~500K-1M (potential) | Legalized April 2024, 4.5M consumers |

| Australia/NZ | ~100-200K | Medical programs |
| **Total** | **~3-4M** | Growing 15-25% annually |

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Primary:** Indoor growers with 2+ tents/grow spaces running perpetual harvest setups.

**Characteristics:**
- Already invested $500-2,000+ in equipment
- Serious about optimization and yields
- Tech-savvy enough to use planning software
- Spending $500-2,000/year on equipment, seeds, nutrients

**Estimated ICP size:** 1-1.5M globally (30-40% of indoor growers)

### Market Validation

**Equipment market sizes (2024):**
- Grow Lights: $2B → $6.4B by 2029 (26.5% CAGR)
- Grow Tents: $270-580M → $400-940M by 2031 (6-7% CAGR)
- Cannabis Cultivation: $4.15B → $12.27B by 2032 (14.5% CAGR)

**Key insight:** If Spider Farmer, Mars Hydro, and VIVOSUN can build $50-100M+ businesses selling hardware to this market, there's room for software tools.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| App | Users | Model | Focus | Weakness vs Plantegia |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| **Grow with Jane** | 500K+ | Freemium subscription | Grow diary, single plant tracking | No spatial planning, no multi-tent view |
| **GrowBuddy** | Unknown | Free (rebuilding) | Grow journal | Unstable, no space planning |
| **Bud (app)** | Small | Free | Social grow journal | Community focus, not planning |
| **BudLabs** | Unknown | Free (by Advanced Nutrients) | Nutrient calculator | Single purpose, brand lock-in |

### Competitive Advantage

**No existing tool combines:**
1. Spatial view (tent/room layout with plant positions)
2. Temporal view (Gantt-style timeline across growth stages)
3. Multi-space management (2+ tents simultaneously)

**Plantegia is the only tool for planning, not just logging.**
