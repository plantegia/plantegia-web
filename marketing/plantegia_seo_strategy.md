# Plantegia — Inbound & SEO Strategy (Phase 1)

## Strategic Overview

### Goal
Generate 30,000-50,000 organic website visitors in Year 1, converting 1.5-3% to paying customers (500-1,000 sales).

### Approach
Content-led SEO targeting underserved long-tail keywords in the cannabis/indoor growing space. Focus on **planning problems**, not grow diaries (where competition is saturated).

### Key Insight
Existing content focuses on "how to grow" and "grow journals." Almost nobody addresses **"how to plan and schedule multiple grow spaces"** — this is Plantegia's SEO moat.

## Link Building Strategy (Organic)

### Strategy 1: Resource Link Building

- Forum threads asking for planning tools
- Reddit posts about scheduling

**Assets to create:**
1. Perpetual Harvest Calculator (embeddable)
2. Printable schedule templates (PDF)
3. Tent spacing calculator

### Strategy 2: Community Participation

**Platforms:**
- Reddit (r/microgrowery, r/Autoflowers, etc.)
- THCFarmer forums
- Grasscity forums
- RollItUp forums
- Overgrow.com
- GrowDiaries

**Approach:**
- Answer scheduling/planning questions genuinely
- Share helpful insights without promotion
- Only link to content when directly relevant and helpful
- Build reputation before any promotion

**Do:**
- Spend 80% helping, 20% (soft) promoting
- Save comments linking to your content for genuinely perfect fits
- Build karma/reputation first (2-4 weeks minimum)

**Don't:**
- Drop links in every comment
- Self-promote in subreddits that ban it
- Create fake accounts or astroturf

### Strategy 3: Content Syndication

**Approach:** Repurpose content for other platforms with backlinks.

**Platforms:**
- Medium (republish with canonical)
- LinkedIn articles (for professional angle)
- YouTube descriptions (video content)

**Platforms:**

- SourceBottle

**Angle:** Position as "indoor gardening planning expert" (broader than just cannabis).

## Appendix: Competitor Content Gaps

### What Exists (Saturated)

- Generic "how to grow cannabis" guides
- Strain reviews
- Grow diaries / journals
- Nutrient schedules
- Single-plant growing guides

### What's Missing (Opportunity)

- **Multi-tent scheduling calculators** ← Plantegia opportunity
- **Visual space planning tools** ← Plantegia opportunity
- **Perpetual harvest timing calculators** ← Plantegia opportunity
- Interactive planning vs static guides
- German-language planning content
- Autoflower-specific rotation planning

### Top Competing Articles to Outrank

1. GrowWeedEasy: "The Perpetual Harvest" — Good but no interactive tools
2. Leafly: "How to Maintain a Perpetual Harvest" — Comprehensive but generic
3. 2Fast4Buds: "Ultimate Guide to Perpetual Harvest" — Autoflower focused only
4. RollItUp thread: "Anatomy of a Perpetual Grow Cycle" — Forum format, not optimized

**Strategy:** Create more comprehensive, interactive, and visually helpful content than all of these.
