          <h2>The Short Version</h2>
          <p>Plantegia is a planning tool. You're responsible for what you plan. We're not your lawyer, your mom, or your government. Use this tool for legal purposes in your jurisdiction. Be cool. Don't be an asshole. That's basically it.</p>
          <p>If you need the long version for legal reasons, keep reading.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. What Plantegia Is</h2>
          <p>Plantegia is software for planning indoor garden cycles across multiple grow spaces. It helps you visualize where your plants are, when they move, and what happens next.</p>
          <p>We don't sell plants, seeds, nutrients, equipment, or advice. We sell a planning tool. What you grow is your business — literally and legally.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. What Plantegia Isn't</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Not a legal service.</strong> We can't tell you what's legal to grow where you live.</li>
            <li><strong>Not agricultural advice.</strong> We're software people, not botanists.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a community.</strong> No forums, no social features, no data sharing (unless you want that someday, and we'll ask first).</li>
            <li><strong>Not surveillance.</strong> We don't track what you plan. Your data stays yours.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>By using Plantegia, you agree that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You'll follow your local laws.</strong> Whatever those are. Wherever you are. We don't know your situation and we're not going to pretend we do.</li>
            <li><strong>You're an adult.</strong> Or whatever age makes you legally capable of entering agreements where you live.</li>
            <li><strong>You won't blame us for your decisions.</strong> Plantegia is a calendar with spatial awareness. If you do something stupid, illegal, or both — that's on you.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Our Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>We promise to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep your data private.</strong> We don't sell it, share it, or look at it. Your plans are yours.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the software work.</strong> If it breaks, we'll fix it. If you find a bug, tell us.</li>
            <li><strong>Be honest about what we can and can't do.</strong> No bullshit marketing, no fake features, no vaporware.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We don't promise:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>That the software will be available 100% of the time</li>
            <li>That it will work perfectly on every device ever made</li>
            <li>That it will make you a better gardener (though it might)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Payment & Refunds</h2>
          <p><strong>Price:</strong> One-time payment. No subscriptions. You buy it, you own it.</p>
          <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> If Plantegia genuinely doesn't work for you and you contact us within 14 days of purchase, we'll refund you. No interrogation, no hoops. Just tell us what went wrong so we can fix it for others.</p>
          <p><strong>What's not refundable:</strong> "I changed my mind" after 14 days. "I thought it did something else" when the features are clearly listed. "The cops showed up" — seriously, we told you to check your local laws.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p><strong>Ours:</strong> The Plantegia name, logo, code, and design belong to us.</p>
          <p><strong>Yours:</strong> Everything you create with Plantegia — your plans, your data, your grow schedules — belongs to you. We claim no rights over your content.</p>
          <p><strong>Open source stuff:</strong> We use open source libraries. They have their own licenses. We respect those and you should too.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. Privacy (The Short Version)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>We collect only what we need to make the software work</li>
            <li>We don't sell your data</li>
            <li>We don't track you across the internet</li>
            <li>We use cookies only for functionality, not advertising</li>
            <li>If you delete your account, we delete your data</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Full privacy policy is separate, but this is the spirit of it. <a href="/privacy">Read our Privacy Policy</a></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>8. Termination</h2>
          <p><strong>You can leave anytime.</strong> Delete your account, uninstall the app, never come back. No hard feelings.</p>
          <p><strong>We can terminate your access if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>You use Plantegia to harm others</li>
            <li>You try to reverse-engineer, hack, or resell our software</li>
            <li>You're actually being an asshole in ways we haven't anticipated but will know when we see</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
          <p class="caps-text">THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE DON'T GUARANTEE IT WILL MAKE YOUR PLANTS GROW BETTER, HELP YOU BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT, OR IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS.</p>
          <p class="caps-text">IN NO EVENT SHALL PLANTEGIA BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE. THIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO: DEAD PLANTS, MISSED HARVESTS, LEGAL TROUBLES, RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS, OR EXISTENTIAL CRISES.</p>
          <p><em>(Sorry for the caps. Lawyers like caps. We don't make the rules.)</em></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>These terms are governed by the laws of Estonia, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes will be resolved in Estonian courts.</p>
          <p>If that sounds weird to you: Estonia is a small, tech-forward country in Northern Europe with excellent digital infrastructure and a rational approach to regulation. It's not a tax haven or a legal loophole. It's just where we're based.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
          <p>We might update these terms occasionally. If we do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We'll post the new version on our website</li>
            <li>We'll note the date it was updated</li>
            <li>If the changes are significant, we'll let you know via email</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Continuing to use Plantegia after changes means you accept them. If you don't accept them, stop using the software. We'll miss you, but we'll understand.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>12. Contact</h2>
          <p>Questions? Problems? Existential gardening dilemmas?</p>
          <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:builder@plantegia.com">builder@plantegia.com</a></p>
          <p>We read everything. We reply to most things. We're humans, not a support ticket system.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="philosophy">
          <h2>The Philosophical Bit</h2>
          <p>We built Plantegia because we believe in planning, growing, and self-reliance. We believe technology should help people do more with less — less waste, less confusion, less dependency on systems that don't care about them.</p>
          <p>We're not here to judge what you grow. We're here to help you grow it better.</p>
          <p>Stay curious. Plan ahead. Trust the process.</p>
        </section>

        <p class="acknowledgment"><em>By using Plantegia, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service.</em></p>
        <p class="acknowledgment"><em>If you didn't read them: the gist is "be cool, follow your local laws, and don't blame us for your choices." That's really it.</em></p>
